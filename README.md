# c-boilerplate

c-boilerplate provides a starting point for consistent and well-formatted C projects, built to be
lightweight and usable with minimum installation, and providing minimum project functionality to
preserve honor code guidelines for university projects.

You're welcome to make changes, as per the MIT license included, but please fork first! I'd also

## Boilerplate Notes (DO NOT REMOVE)

This project is built on a boilerplate setup created by Jake Nichols (109450366), specifically for
CSCI 3753 at CU Boulder (Operating Systems), but generally functional for C programming. It provides
testing functionality, formatting, and linting to create readable, consistent, and working code.
The base setup can be found at their GitHub page here. Please see the license for usage information.
