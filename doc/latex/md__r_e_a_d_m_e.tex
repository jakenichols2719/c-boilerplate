This project is built on a boilerplate setup created by Jake Nichols (109450366), specifically for CSCI 3753 and 3010 at CU Boulder, but generally functional for C programming. It provides testing functionality, formatting, and linting to create readable, consistent, and working code. The base setup can be found at their Git\+Hub page here. Please see the license for usage information.
